Goal:
-This class stores the basic description and points attribute required by each class.
-Contains 3 abstract methods that will be overridden by the subclasses.
-Gets the point value of the recorded event. This will look different for each class.
-Determines whether a goal is completed/it's state of completion.
-Displays the goal. Again, this will work differentely depending on the class.

SimpleGoal:
-Tracks whether the goal is complete or incomplete.
-Allows the user to mark the goal as done, giving the user points for completion.
-Displays the goal description, completion state (complete/incomplete), and point value.

EternalGoal:
-Tracks how many times the goal has been "completed".
-Allows the user to increase the number of times this goal has been completed.
-Displays the goal description, number of completions, and point value per completion.

ChecklistGoal:
-Tracks the state of completion for the goal, how many recorded events are required
for completion, and bonus points for completing the goal.
-Allows the user to increase the number of times the required event has been met.
-Displays the goal description, state of completion, point value per event, and final
bonus value.

File:
-This class will serialize the attributes of each initialized subclass as a string.
The values will be separated by characters unlikely to naturally appear in the string (Something like ||).
-It will de-serialize the string into its individual attributes, and initialize new
classes for each one. Will need a way to determine which subclass to create.
-Will save/load a specific file, set by the user.

-Each class will likely need some getters for their attributes. These will get the
required information to save/serialize the file. Setters might not be necessary since
the constructor generally takes care of setting the attributes.

-The basic Program will handle the options menu and the initialization/creation of
another class. It will then store that class to a list.
