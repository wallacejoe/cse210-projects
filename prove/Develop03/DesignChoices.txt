Reference:
-Formats the provided text to be usable by the Scripture class, will likely be formatted as a single string.
-Stores the full scripture reference, incase it should be needed again, such as for a restart option.
-This class will be used at the start of the program to give the scripture class needed data
it may not have much use after that.

Scripture:
-The initial constructor will parse the string, provided by the Reference class, and save it to an attribute.
-The hiddenNum attribute will contain the number of 'hidden' strings. This should allow me
to determine when all of the text is hidden.
-Will end the program when all text is hidden.
-It may keep two string variables, one list type and one generic string. Is a generic string necessary/useful?
-Hidden words will be replaced with the underscore (_) character.
-Will keep track of hidden words somehow.

Word:
-Will be responsible for hiding random words, while avoiding already hidden words.
-Stores all words, as either hidden or shown, to an array.
-Returns the array to the Scripture class.
-Increases the hiddenNum attribute of the Scripture class.

Use Word or Scripture for the primary display class?
All attribute, and most methods, will be kept private for more compact classes.

Clear screen:
-Whichever class is used for displaying will clear the screen just befor display.

File Reading:
-I may add file reading capabilities to the Program, this would allow for greater scripture variety.
-Would like to make it CSV compatible, if I can manage it.
-An additional method would be required to read and format the files content.
