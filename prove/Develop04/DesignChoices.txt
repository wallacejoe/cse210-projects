-Contains the basic start and end messages/methods required by each class.
-The start message will take user input setting the value of the duration attribute.

about these processes yet, but I imagine they will need to return strings, TBD.

Note: the duration attribute will be a default, if the user enters a valid number
the default will not be used.

-Between questions the spinner method will display. I haven't yet decide for how long.
